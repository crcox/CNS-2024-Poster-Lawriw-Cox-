	abstract = {The hippocampus replays experiences during quiet rest periods, and this replay benefits subsequent memory. A critical open question is how memories are prioritized for this replay. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) pattern analysis to track item-level replay in the hippocampus during an awake rest period after participants studied 15 objects and completed a memory test. Objects that were remembered less well were replayed more during the subsequent rest period, suggesting a prioritization process in which weaker memories—memories most vulnerable to forgetting—are selected for replay. In a second session 12 hours later, more replay of an object during a rest period predicted better subsequent memory for that object. Replay predicted memory improvement across sessions only for participants who slept during that interval. Our results provide evidence that replay in the human hippocampus prioritizes weakly learned information, predicts subsequent memory performance, and relates to memory improvement across a delay with sleep.},

Research on event perception has focused on transient elevations in predictive uncertainty or surprise as the primary signal driving event segmentation. We present human behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) evidence in favor of a different account, in which event representations coalesce around clusters or ‘communities’ of mutually predicting stimuli. Through parsing behavior, {fMRI} adaptation and multivoxel pattern analysis, we demonstrate the emergence of event representations in a domain containing such community structure, but in which transition probabilities (the basis of uncertainty and surprise) are uniform. We present a computational account of how the relevant representations might arise, proposing a direct connection between event learning and the learning of semantic categories.},

	abstract = {Emotional events are remembered better than neutral events possibly because the amygdala enhances the function of medial temporal lobe ({MTL}) memory system (modulation hypothesis). Although this hypothesis has been supported by much animal research, evidence from humans has been scarce and indirect. We investigated this issue using event-related {fMRI} during encoding of emotional and neutral pictures. Memory performance after scanning showed a retention advantage for emotional pictures. Successful encoding activity in the amygdala and {MTL} memory structures was greater and more strongly correlated for emotional than for neutral pictures. Moreover, a double dissociation was found along the longitudinal axis of the {MTL} memory system: activity in anterior regions predicted memory for emotional items, whereas activity in posterior regions predicted memory for neutral items. These results provide direct evidence for the modulation hypothesis in humans and reveal a functional specialization within the {MTL} regarding the effects of emotion on memory formation.},

	abstract = {The human ventromedial prefrontal cortex ({vmPFC})/anterior cingulate cortex is implicated in reward and emotion, but also in memory. It is shown how the human orbitofrontal cortex connecting with the {vmPFC} and anterior cingulate cortex provide a route to the hippocampus for reward and emotional value to be incorporated into episodic memory, enabling memory of where a reward was seen. It is proposed that this value component results in primarily episodic memories with some value component to be repeatedly recalled from the hippo­ campus so that they are more likely to become incorporated into neocortical semantic and autobiographical memories. The same orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate regions also connect in humans to the septal and basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei, thereby helping to consolidate memory, and helping to account for why damage to the {vMPFC} impairs memory. The human hippocampus and {vmPFC} thus contribute in complementary ways to forming episodic and semantic memories.},

	abstract = {Emotional arousal, mediated by the amygdala, is known to modulate episodic memories stored by the hippocampus, a region involved in pattern separation (the process by which similar representations are independently stored). While emotional modulation and pattern separation have been examined independently, this study attempts to link the two areas of research to propose an alternative account for how emotion modulates episodic memory. We used an emotional discrimination task designed to tax pattern separation of emotional information by concurrently varying emotional valence and similarity of stimuli. To examine emotional modulation of memory at the level of hippocampal subfields, we used high-resolution {fMRI} (1.5 mm isotropic) of the medial temporal lobe. Consistent with prior reports, we observed engagement of the hippocampal dentate gyrus ({DG}) and {CA}3 during accurate discrimination of highly similar items (behavioral correlate of pattern separation). Furthermore, we observed an emotional modulation of this signal (negative {\textgreater} neutral) specific to trials on which participants accurately discriminated similar emotional items. The amygdala was also modulated by emotion, regardless of the accuracy of discrimination. Additionally, we found aberrant amygdala-hippocampal network activity in a sample of adults with depressive symptoms. In this sample, amygdala activation was enhanced and {DG}/{CA}3 activation was diminished during emotional discrimination compared to those without depressive symptoms. Depressive symptom severity was also negatively correlated with {DG}/{CA}3 activity. This study suggests a novel mechanistic account for how emotional information is processed by hippocampal subfields as well as how this network may be altered in mood disorders. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Damage to the hippocampal system disrupts recent memory but leaves remote memory intact. The account presented here suggests that memories are first stored via synaptic changes in the hippocampal system, that these changes support reinstatement of recent memories in the neocortex, that neocortical synapses change a little on each reinstatement, and that remote memory is based on accumulated neocortical changes. Models that learn via changes to connections help explain this organization. These models discover the structure in ensembles of items if learning of each item is gradual and interleaved with learning about other items. This suggests that the neocortex learns slowly to discover the structure in ensembles of experiences. The hippocampal system permits rapid learning of new items without disrupting this structure, and reinstatement of new memories interleaves them with others to integrate them into structured neocortical memory systems.

	abstract = {Well-documented differences in the psychology and behavior of men and women have spurred extensive exploration of gender's role within the brain, particularly regarding emotional processing. While neuroanatomical studies clearly show differences between the sexes, the functional effects of these differences are less understood. Neuroimaging studies have shown inconsistent locations and magnitudes of gender differences in brain hemodynamic responses to emotion. To better understand the neurophysiology of these gender differences, we analyzed recordings of single neuron activity in the human brain as subjects of both genders viewed emotional expressions. This study included recordings of single-neuron activity of 14 (6 male) epileptic patients in four brain areas: amygdala (236 neurons), hippocampus (n=270), anterior cingulate cortex (n=256), and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (n=174). Neural activity was recorded while participants viewed a series of avatar male faces portraying positive, negative or neutral expressions. Significant gender differences were found in the left amygdala, where 23\% (n=15/66) of neurons in men were significantly affected by facial emotion, versus 8\% (n=6/76) of neurons in women. A Fisher's exact test comparing the two ratios found a highly significant difference between the two (p{\textless}0.01). These results show specific differences between genders at the single-neuron level in the human amygdala. These differences may reflect gender-based distinctions in evolved capacities for emotional processing and also demonstrate the importance of including subject gender as an independent factor in future studies of emotional processing by single neurons in the human amygdala.},

Second, we imposed a computational unfolding framework that respects the topological continuity of hippocampal subfields, which are traditionally defined by laminar composition. Third, we adapted neocortical parcellation techniques to map the hippocampus with respect to not only laminar but also morphological features. Unsupervised clustering of these features revealed subdivisions that closely resemble gold standard manual subfield segmentations. Critically, we also show that morphological features alone are sufficient to derive most hippocampal subfield boundaries. Moreover, some features showed differences within subfields along the hippocampal longitudinal axis. Our findings highlight new characteristics of internal hippocampal structure, and offer new avenues for its characterization with in-vivo neuroimaging.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal subfield atrophy is a prime structural change in the brain, associated with cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Recent developments in genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) have identified genetic loci that characterize the risk of hippocampal volume loss based on the processes of normal and abnormal aging. Polygenic risk scores are the genetic proxies mimicking the genetic role of the pre-existing vulnerabilities of the underlying mechanisms influencing these changes. Discriminating the genetic predispositions of hippocampal subfield atrophy between cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases will be helpful in understanding the disease etiology. In this study, we evaluated the polygenic risk of Alzheimer’s disease ({AD} {PGRS}) for hippocampal subfield atrophy in 1,086 individuals (319 cognitively normal ({CN}), 591 mild cognitively impaired ({MCI}), and 176 Alzheimer’s disease dementia ({ADD})). Our results showed a stronger association of {AD} {PGRS} effect on the left hemisphere than on the right hemisphere for all the hippocampal subfield volumes in a mixed clinical population ({CN}+{MCI}+{ADD}). The subfields {CA}1, {CA}4, hippocampal tail, subiculum, presubiculum, molecular layer, {GC}-{ML}-{DG}, and {HATA} showed stronger {AD} {PGRS} associations with the {MCI}+{ADD} group than with the {CN} group. The subfields {CA}3, parasubiculum, and fimbria showed moderately higher {AD} {PGRS} associations with the {MCI}+{ADD} group than with the {CN} group. Our findings suggest that the eight subfield regions, which were strongly associated with {AD} {PGRS} are likely involved in the early stage {ADD} and a specific focus on the left hemisphere could enhance the early prediction of {ADD}.},
